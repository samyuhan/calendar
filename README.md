# calendar
For this homework assignment, I had to create a daily planner that has the feature to input and save your daily schedule. At the top of the page, the current date is listed. If you refresh the page, the saved text is still visible because it was saved to the local storage. Each row for the hour is grey, red, or green to show if it is past, present, or future.

## Technologies Used
For this assignment, I coded in HTML/CSS and Javascript, using Bootstrap and JQuery.
